# Docker Compose - Microsoft SQL Server

Velkommen, today we are going to learn how to use a Microsoft SQL server in a containerized environment using docker-compose ( multiple container environments). If you are interested in learning what docker-compose is please read my previous article here and also on the official docker's website here.
We will use Asp.net core MVC (front-end) and Asp-net WebAPI ( backend) projects to demonstrate the concept. With the front end communicating to the backend API the Backend API will communicate with the SQL server only.
